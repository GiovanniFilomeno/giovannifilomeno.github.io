I am a **Senior AI/ML Engineer** based in Munich, passionate about bridging the gap between rigorous numerical optimization and modern deep learning. 

[cite_start]Currently, I work as **AI/ML Lead Engineer** at **BMW Group**, where I manage strategic initiatives in Predictive Maintenance and Natural Language Processing (NLP)[cite: 104]. [cite_start]My role involves leading cross-functional task forces to solve critical engineering challenges, deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for diagnostic systems, and managing cloud infrastructure for high-throughput data pipelines[cite: 104].

My background is rooted in the intersection of engineering and mathematics. I hold a **Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing.)[cite_start]** in Optimization and Numerical Methods from **Ruhr-University Bochum**, where I developed genetic algorithms for simulation-driven design automation[cite: 34]. [cite_start]I also hold Master's degrees in Computational Mechanics and Management from the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**[cite: 37, 40].

[cite_start]Driven by a constant desire to learn, I am currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence** at **Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz**[cite: 22]. My recent research focuses on **Multimodal Learning** and **Audio Retrieval**, specifically exploring how to handle missing modalities and align textual intent with audio signals. [cite_start]I recently demonstrated this by outperforming the baseline in the **DCASE 2025 Challenge** using a custom PaSST + RoBERTa dual-encoder architecture[cite: 128, 131].

I am always open to discussing new challenges in:
* **Multimodal Recommender Systems**
* **Deep Learning & NLP** (Transformers, RAG, LLM Fine-tuning)
* **Numerical Optimization** (Genetic Algorithms, Multi-objective problems)
